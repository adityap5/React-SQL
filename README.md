Book Store Web Application

Project Overview
This is a full-stack Book Store Web Application developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with SQL for the backend. The app allows users to browse, search for books, and manage book inventory in a seamless, user-friendly interface. It utilizes RESTful API endpoints to manage the flow of data between the client and server efficiently.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Responsive design built with React.js for browsing and searching books.
Book Inventory Management: Supports adding, updating, and deleting book entries in the inventory.
Search Functionality: Users can search for books by title or author.
RESTful API: The application follows REST principles, enabling smooth data communication between the frontend and backend.
SQL Database: Manages book inventory and user data using SQL for fast and reliable data management.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (with Hooks, Axios for API requests)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (for building the API)
Database: SQL (for managing book and user data)
Other Tools: Postman (for API testing), Git (for version control)
